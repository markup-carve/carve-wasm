"""Print the spec commit that the carve-rs revision this package pins was written against.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The blocking corpus gate used to check out markup-carve/carve
at its DEFAULT BRANCH. That asks: is this artifact conformant with the spec as
it stands right now? No change in this repository can answer yes to that. The
spec adds documents continuously - it gained a whole category on 2026-08-18
while a release was in flight - and an engine implements them some time later.
In between, every pull request here is red for a reason that has nothing to do
with its diff, and the fix lives in another repository.

That is how it actually failed. carve-py's v0.1.1 tag built all three wheels,
published its GitHub release, and then SKIPPED `Publish to PyPI` because the
gate held the wheel to corpus category 367, which does not exist at the spec
commit that release pins and which no engine revision available that day
rendered. The tag said 0.1.1 and `pip install` served the vulnerable 0.1.0.

A gate in that state cannot pass by construction whenever the spec moves after
an engine is tagged, which is always. And a gate that cannot pass is a gate
everyone learns to skip - the "check that cannot fail" of markup-carve/carve#755
arriving by the opposite road.

The question this repository CAN answer, and the only one it can act on, is
whether the artifact is as conformant as the engine it was built from. The
pinned carve-rs revision's `tests/spec` gitlink names the spec that engine was
written against, and the corpus at that commit is what it claims to implement.
That is the commit this prints, and holding the gate to it is what makes the
gate clearable by an action taken here: bump the pin.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT BUY. An artifact that is simply OLD - pin and
bytes agreeing on an engine from a month ago - passes the gate that uses this.
That is what the non-blocking `corpus-drift` job reports, and it is why deleting
that job would turn the re-aiming into a loosening.

This is modelled on the same resolution carve-go performs inline in its `corpus`
job. It is a script rather than four copies of a shell snippet because two
workflows here (ci.yml and release.yml) need the identical answer, and two
spellings of one rule is how they come to disagree.

    python3 scripts/pinned-spec-commit.py \
        --engine carve-rs --manifest Cargo.toml --lock Cargo.lock

Exit codes: 0 the commit was resolved and printed on stdout, 1 the pin or the
gitlink could not be resolved, 2 usage or setup error.
